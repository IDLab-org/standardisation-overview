#  [DRAFT] SSI Standardisation Overview

Technologies within the context of SSI range from technical solutions like decentralised public key infrastructure (DPKI) to high-level concepts like guardianship. When encountering a new standard, it can be hard to figure out its context:
-	What does the technology described in the standard achieve?
-	Is this technology compatible with or competitive to other standard y?
-	Is this standard part of an interoperability profile?

To answer these questions, we have developed a [graphical overview](https://tno-ssi-lab.github.io/standardisation-overview/) of SSI-related standards and an accompanying [documentation](https://tno-ssi-lab.github.io/standardisation-overview/docs.html). The overview is structured along the [ToIP Technology Stack](https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/). These documents are a first draft and should be considered work in progress.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions. You can contribute through raising issues or by forking the repository. To edit the graphic overview, alter ```standards-overview-v2.drawio``` and export it as ```index.html```. To update the documentation, alter ```docs.md``` and generate ```docs.html```.
