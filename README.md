#  SSI Standardisation Overview

Technologies within the context of SSI range from technical solutions like decentralised public key infrastructure (DPKI) to high-level concepts like guardianship. When encountering a new standard, it can be hard to figure out its context:
-	What does the technology described in the standard achieve?
-	Is this technology compatible or competitive with other standard y?
-	Is this standard part of an interoperability profile?

To answer these questions, we have developed a [graphical overview](https://tno-ssi-lab.github.io/Standardisation-Overview/) of SSI-related standards and an accompanying [documentation](https://tno-ssi-lab.github.io/Standardisation-Overview/docs.html).
